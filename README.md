# MENU Technologies take home test

My solution can be found live [here](https://menu-frontend-test.netlify.app/)

Running the solution locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Boki87/menu-frontend-test.git

npm install
```

One thing I did add on top of the requirements is make it responsive, so it should be functional on mobile devices as well.

Resources used to complete the test:

- Test Guidelines [PDF](resources/test.pdf)
- Figma design [DESIGN](https://www.figma.com/file/JbfOSv1bZM77D1NnIZotK8/Candidate-Test-MC)
